<body><h1 class="c13" id="h.yakc53yu540e"><span class="c7 c8">Welcome To TheCommunityEarth!</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c9">This document works as a semi-alternate tutorial to teach new players how to get started on TheCommunityEarth. There are currently no other guides like it out there, making this the go-to place for players interested in getting into TCE.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c9 c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">First off, you can connect to the 1.12.2 server through</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;thecommunity.earth </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7 c14"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c9 c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">#1: Creating Your Town</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4">To get started, youâ€™ll need a town.</span><span class="c5">If you wish to join a town instead of creating one, skip to </span><span class="c5">section 1.3</span><span class="c4">. To start, go and find the NPC named Warps. Clicking on that NPC brings up continents you can teleport to. Once you have located your desired continent, click on the Item corresponding to the Continent Name and find an unclaimed plot of land. Once you have found a place to settle down, type the desired town name you wish to claim by doing </span><span class="c5">/t create [Name]</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;.(Replace [Name] with desired name. Ex: /t create Macao ) &nbsp;to access the Town GUI Menu, do /t . To see more /t commands, </span><span class="c11"><a class="c2" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny/wiki/Towny-Commands&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1593339550793000">Click Here</a></span><span class="c4 c7">. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">#1.1: Managing Your Town</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4 c7">Town Permissions are one of the most confusing aspects of the game. The default configuration of the permissions permits Recruits to Build / Destroy , Members to Interact with Doors, Chests, etc , Co-Leader with the ability to basically do anything. You can change your permissions to allow allies to modify your Town Builds by doing /t set perm ally on , or to turn it off /t set perm ally off. You can also promote / demote members of your town using the GUI, giving or revoking permissions from them. We heavily recommend you explore the Town Settings GUI by clicking on the corresponding item in the Town GUI or doing /to . Not a fan of the GUI? Thats ok, /tow is a text GUI based version of this.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">#1.2: Town Financials</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4">Each town requires Upkeep to keep their town alive. Upkeep is calculated based upon the total number of claims a town owns and its population. To pay Upkeep, just deposit money into your town bank using </span><span class="c5">/t deposit [Amount of $] </span><span class="c4 c7">and it will subtract upkeep from the town bank every Upkeep cycle. If there is not enough cash in the bank to keep all the land, the town falls into ruin and loses all its territory</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">#1.3: Joining a Town</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c7">To join a town instead, ask for somebody to invite you by doing /t invite [Your Name] . This will send you an invite asking you if you would like to join the town in question. Type /accept and you are in! </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4 c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">#2: Economy</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c7">TheCommunityEarth uses an economy system. To check your balance, do /bal. To increase your balance, you may sell items using the /sell command. However, we recommend you exercise caution while selling to avoid selling valuables. There are also multiple other methods of increasing your balance. Such as people paying you using /pay, Killing Players gives out 15% of their cash capped at 1000. You may also trade with other players using the /trade command.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">#3: Quests</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c7">Quests on TheCommunityEarth grant quest points. Quest Points are form of non-transferrable currency that can unlock content such as Events, Weapons and more! Quests can also award you with in game currency. &nbsp;To take a quest, go talk to Warps at spawn and warp to The Warps Catalog. After finding a quest to take, talk to the NPC to take the quest and follow its request! As a quick tip, many quests are redoable. We do highly suggest taking a few quests early on as they can give you a good boost in progress.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">#4: Other Tutorials</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c7">Here are a list of other Staff Approved Tutorials that help out with any issues you may have!</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4 c7"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4 c7"></span></p>
